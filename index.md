## 👋 About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Harry Qin](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/sn/people/academic-staff/prof-harry-qin/?sc_lang=tc) on multi-modal learning for healthcare applications. I also have the privilege of collaborating with [Prof. Wenfang Yao](https://dorothy-yao.github.io/) and [Prof. Kejing Yin](https://kejing.me/). I began my research journey during my B.Eng. in Software Engineering at the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/).


Outside research, I enjoy running, playing volleyball, hiking, and spending time outdoors with friends.
